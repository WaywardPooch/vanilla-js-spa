# Vanilla JS Single Page App

Single page application built in vanilla JavaScript, using https://github.com/DrewWarrenTIY/utah-js-conf-2019 as a reference.

The current state management system here can definitely be improved; this project was made so I could better understand how single-page web apps can work without reliance on a framework, such as React.
